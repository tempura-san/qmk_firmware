# Anne Pro German (based on default/Windows) keymap

Maintainer: [tempura-san](https://github.com/tempura-san)

This keymap is based off the default Windows keymap supplied by the original Anne Pro firmware. However the interface for Bluetooth is changed slightly and support for quick access to German umlauts was added.

## Bluetooth

To enable the Bluetooth layer press `FN+B`.

While in the Bluetooth layer:

- `ESC` - Exit the Bluetooth layer
- `1, 2, 3, 4` - Connect to a saved profile
- `Q, W, E, R` - Save connection to a profile
- `A, S, D, F` - Delete a saved connection
- `0` - Toggle legacy (Windows 7 and older) Bluetooth mode
- `-` - Disable Bluetooth
- `+` - Enable Bluetooth

Finally the lighting on the `ESC` key tries to indicate the connection status of the Bluetooth. However this might sometimes go out of sync. To update the connection status press the left `CTRL` key.

## German Umlauts

Additional to the international US entry system (e.g. `AltGr + P` = `ö`), the following shortcuts are available:

- `ANNE + A` - ä
- `ANNE + O` - ö
- `ANNE + U` - ü
- `ANNE + S` - ß
